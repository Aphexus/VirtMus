Summary
=======

VirtMus (virtual music) is a free application that allows the user to display
sheet music and turn pages without removing the hands (or feet) from the
instrument the music is performed on. This feature is very useful during
concerts and practice sessions as it allows the musician to focus on performing
the music without interruption. The software also allows the users to store and
organize their entire sheet music collection on a laptop, making it fully
portable and available at a click of a button.
