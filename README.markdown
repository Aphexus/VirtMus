Summary
=======

VirtMus (virtual music) is a free application that allows the user to display
sheet music and turn pages without removing the hands (or feet) from the
instrument the music is performed on. This feature is very useful during
concerts and practice sessions as it allows the musician to focus on performing
the music without interruption. The software also allows the users to store and
organize their entire sheet music collection on a laptop, making it fully
portable and available at a click of a button.

TODO

Java 8 - Broken!!! Weird exceptions and the display is all messed up (nodes don't redraw properly, etc...)
git submodule init

Log how many pages were rendered with PDFRenderer vs ICEpdf
Revisit the selection logic in IcePdfImg and foogly()
Crop bounds seem to be ignored by PDFRenderer (Our Father)
