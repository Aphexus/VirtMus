- Inherit actions from NewAction, CutAction, CopyAction...

- Rework SaveAllAction() to match openide/loaders/src/org/openide/actions/SaveAllAction.java
  or use the openide/SaveAllAction.java itself.

- For YES/NO dialogs, consider using: http://www.netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-dialogs/org/openide/DialogDescriptor.html
    See: http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/DevFaqNbIdeosyncracies

- Make use of the Navigator API for the PlayList top component... ?

USER NOTES
==========
- PNG 32-bit is slow to load, but indexed 8-bit is also slow when it comes to drawing on the LiveScreen.

DEVELOPMENT NOTES
=================
- The Window menu order is maintained in ThumbViewer/layer.xml
- The list of hidden menu items is also maintained in ThumbViewer/layer.xml


FIXED - NOT VERIFIED
====================
- There seems to be some processing build up as pages are cloned and moved around on the Thumbs TopComponent


DONE
====
- Enforce song.xml and playlist.xml file extensions

- BUG: When a song is added to a playlist, the SavePlayListAction.enable function
    is not called to enable the "save" menu. Do we need to do something in
    SongOpenAction?

- See if we need to save anything by trapping exit using the upper-right windows close button
- Might need to copy the code from ExitAction to LifecycleManager
    see: http://www.netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/LifecycleManager.html#exit()
    - Created a VirtMusLifecycleManager inner class in MainApp.java and registered it in the global lookup
      by creating a file in META-INF/services.
